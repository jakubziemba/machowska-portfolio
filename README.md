**A portfolio website for a polish artist.**

For an artist, the most important quality of a website is that it will showcase and truly compliment their art. After seeing the client's work, consulting the ideas and inspirations, I designed and developed the portfolio website.

Because of the inherent minimalism and abstract nature of Roksana's works, we've decided to keep the design as minimal as possible, letting the images, typography and animations play the main role.

For the developement, I used React (Next.js) with CSS Modules and Framer Motion for the animations.
